The walkthrough was recorded using the Windows Snipping Toolâ€™s built-in screen recording feature, and then uploaded to Imgur.

## Notes

Some challenges I faced included ensuring that elements were properly removed before filtering and re-rendering games, and using the ternary operator for dynamic content. Working with the DOM and event listeners gave me helpful practice with JavaScript fundamentals.
